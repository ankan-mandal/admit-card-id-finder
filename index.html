      <p>NOTE: This method work for both class 10 and 12 CBSE.</p>
      <p>Hello everyone,<br />
        I have given my class 12 CBSE board exam the previous year and I successfully got the hard copy of the result
        from school and since you knew there covid is still there and most of the institute is closed so I am also
        sitting at home. I am preparing for giving my entrance examination since I have dropped one year. But suddenly I
        have found that I need class 10th mark sheet soft copy for registration in one of the entrance exams. But I have
        lost the admit card of class 10, I was wondering how I can find my class 10th CBSE Board result with only my
        roll number and date of birth. After finding a lot and researching on the internet I have finally come to an
        answer and today I will be e giving you the trick of how you can also find your admit card ID without your CBSE
        board roll number.</p>
      <p>I know that I am a bit late to answer this question because on the internet there are many articles that
        already have given you the solution. But that's the offline method but today I will show you how you can find
        your CBSE Admit card ID within just 5 seconds online and this is working 100% working. Before finding CBSE Admit
        card ID you need to know what details are required to get your result through CBSE official website. To get your
        result you need to enter your Roll number, School code, Centre code, date of birth and the most important Admit
        card ID. I know most of you can get the school code and Centre code by calling your friends or school but the
        hard thing is to find your CBSE Admit card ID if you have also lost your CBSE Admit Card. You can easily
        calculate your roll number from your friends but the toughest thing is to get the Admit Card ID. There are two
        methods through which you can get your CBSE Admit card ID so let me discuss first the offline method if your
        internet is not working, then you can easily find your admit card ID but it takes time and few calculations are
        needed to be done.</p>
      <p>How to find Admit Card ID - How to check CBSE result without Admit Card ID

        <li>First two digits of the school code</li>
        <li>Last two digits of center number</li>
      </ul>
      <p>using these points find your admit card id and then check the result.</p>

        discussing is 100% legitimate and genuine so you can trust it.</p>
