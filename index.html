		<h1>How to find cbse admit card id</h1>

		<p>Hello everyone,<br/>
I have given my class 12 CBSE board exam the previous year and I successfully got the hard copy of the result from school and since you knew there covid is still there and most of the institute is closed so I am also sitting at home. I am preparing for giving my entrance examination since I have dropped one year. But suddenly I have found that I need class 10th mark sheet soft copy for registration in one of the entrance exams. But I have lost the admit card of class 10, I was wondering how I can find my class 10th CBSE Board result with only my roll number and date of birth. After finding a lot and researching on the internet I have finally come to an answer and today I will be e giving you the trick of how you can also find your admit card ID without your CBSE board roll number.</p>

Before finding CBSE Admit card ID you need to know what details are required to get your result through CBSE official website. To get your result you need to enter your Roll number, School code, Centre code, date of birth and the most important Admit card ID. I know most of you can get the school code and Centre code by calling your friends or school but the hard thing is to find your CBSE Admit card ID if you have also lost your CBSE Admit Card. You can easily calculate your roll number from your friends but the toughest thing is to get the Admit Card ID.

		</ul>
		<p>using these points find your admit card id and then check the result.</p>
